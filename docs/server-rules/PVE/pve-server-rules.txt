1. No Cheating or Exploiting

Cheats, hacks, dupes, mesh, macros, or other unintended mechanics are strictly prohibited. 
Automated detection is active. You will be banned and appeals require evidence - just don't do it

2. Respect All Players

No harassment, hate speech, doxxing, or targeted abuse in chat or DMs. Keep comms helpful and chill—this is PvE.

3. PvE-Only Gameplay

PvP happens only when BOTH tribes publicly declare a Clan War. 
Otherwise, do not grief or sabotage players. Indirect griefing—boxing, body-blocking, caging, trapping beds/TPs, or stealing—is treated as PvP and penalized. Unlocked ≠ consent.

4. Base Location Restrictions

Do not build where it blocks key resources, artifacts,explorer notes, obelisks, mission terminals, supply drops, or major spawns. 
Each tribe may keep 1 main base + 1 outpost per map. 
Perimeter walls are fine—just keep them reasonable to avoid performance issues.

5. Tame & Structure Limits

Follow posted tame/structure caps. 
Keep breeding pens tidy (disable wandering, clean babies/eggs); cryo storage when idle. 
If an admin asks you to reduce, do so within a reasonable window.

Do not spam foundations or structures. If we see it you are gone... period

Dead tames: If your dino dies due to in game events admins will not replace them. 
You may collect their soul and try to go about getting them back via Oasisaur if you wish.

You may server hop from PVE to PVP with your tamed dinos.
Just be aware PVP Server Rules differ from PVE Server Rules. 
If you loose your PVE tames in PVP admins will not replace them.

6. World Etiquette

Do not kite wilds, alphas, or bosses into bases or public areas. 
Public traps/resource collectors must be set Unlocked and left clear; don’t claim or wall off community utilities. 
No cave builds that restrict progression—clear after farming and let others pass.

7. Drops / OBs / Terminals

Do not camp or block. 
Queue fairly—first-come, first-served. 
Be patient during events this includes Shiny Dino spawns. 

8. Trading & Economy

Trade honestly in the Discord trade channels; admins may mediate disputes. 
Trading outposts are allowed if tidy, accessible, and non-blocking. 
Currency: earn 20 Coins/hour; 100 Copper = 1 Silver; 100 Silver = 1 Gold.

9. Names & Builds

No offensive/NSFW tribe, player, or dino names; no hateful symbols or signage. 
Keep bases neat and visually reasonable for community vibes.

10. Abandoned Structures & Tames

After the decay timer, admins may remove or claim to free space and improve performance. If moving or quitting, demo extras and rehome/cryo excess tames.

11. Admin & Enforcement

Admin decisions are final. Penalties escalate from warnings to wipes/timeouts/bans. Report issues with screenshots and coords; false reports may be penalized.
