1. No Cheating or Exploiting

    Use of cheats, hacks, duping, mesh exploits, or unintended game mechanics to gain an advantage is strictly prohibited.

    We have automated systems in place to detect and ban for these activities — just don’t do it.

2. Respect All Players

    No harassment, hate speech, excessive trash talk, or targeting players outside of normal gameplay.

    Keep it fun and fair for everyone.

3. No Griefing or Excessive Raiding

    Do not repeatedly raid the same tribe/base in a short timeframe to the point of preventing recovery.

    Give players time to rebuild and re-engage.

4. Base Location Restrictions

    Avoid building in areas that block key resources, obelisks, mission terminals, or major spawn points.

    Any form of resource blocking is strictly prohibited.

    Each tribe is allowed 1 main base and 1 outpost to keep things fair.

    Walls are allowed, but not in excessive quantities that affect gameplay or server performance.

5. Tame & Structure Limits

    Respect server-specific tame caps and structure limits to avoid performance issues.

    Our cluster is large, but if an admin tells you your build is excessive, you must reduce it.

6. Raid Times

    Offline raiding is allowed unless otherwise stated by an admin.

    You must wait 45 minutes after a player logs off before initiating an offline raid.

7. Trading Rules

    All trades must be fair, honest, and free of scams. Use the approved trade channels in our Discord or contact an admin for mediation if needed.

    Trading outposts are enabled — we encourage you to use them.

    You will earn in-game currency over time, which can be used for trading with others. Don’t throw it away!

Currency Rates:

    20 Copper Coins earned per hour of playtime.

    100 Copper Coins = 1 Silver Coin.

    100 Silver Coins = 1 Gold Coin.

8. No Offensive Builds or Names

    Structures, tribe names, and character names must not contain offensive language, hate speech, or inappropriate content.

9. Abandoned Structures

    Structures inactive beyond the server’s decay timer may be removed by admins to free up space.

10. Follow Admin Instructions

    Admin decisions are final.

    Failure to follow admin directions may result in penalties, including bans.
