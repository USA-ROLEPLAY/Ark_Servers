## 🧭 **Helpful Filters**

- **Game Mode**: Unofficial
- **Show Full/Empty**: Off (optional
- **Crossplay**: On (recommended)
- **Search**: `USARoleplay`

Tip: If the list is busy, try sorting by `Server Name` or `Ping`, then scroll — ours all start with `USARoleplay`.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Pick Your World**

We run multiple maps/servers (PVE & PVP). Choose what fits your vibe:

- **PVE**: Chill progression, building, trading, and community events.
- **PVP**: Competitive survival with clear rules to keep things fair.

## 🌟 **Make Rejoining Easy**

- **Favorite** the server on first join
- Use the **Favorite** tab next time you play — no searching needed.
- If a server doesn’t show up immediately, hit `Refresh` or `Retry` once or twice.

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting (Quick Fixes)**

- **Can’t find the server?**
  - Make sure `Unofficial` is selected and `Crossplay` is enabled.
  - Clear the search box and re-type `USARoleplay`.
  - Refresh the list; sometimes it’s just slow to populate.
- **"Version Mismatch" / "Out of Date"**
  - Restart the game and check for updates.
  - If we just rebooted for updates, give it a minute — the server will reappear.
- **High ping or timeouts**:
  - Try again after a minute (daily restarts or auto-updates may be in progress).
  - Sort by ping and look for another USARoleplay shard/map closer to you.
